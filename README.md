## Introduction to Noted
Noted was an edutech startup that made products for college students to help study for their exams for free.
We worked on it for over 3 years and helped over 10,000 students with it. Now that the startup is 
shut we decided to open source it in hope of inspiring someone else.

## Project details
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) App made for Android. 
App was for gamification for revision for college exams. Collect points
by studying and answering tests. I switched to 
[feature based folder organization](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1) 
which was really scalable as I added more features. Lots of card animations because now I get 60 fps üòç
